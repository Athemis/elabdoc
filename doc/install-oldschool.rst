Install without Docker

Prerequisites
-------------

.. warning:: This method is deprecated. Only use it if you cannot install Docker!

Please refer to your distribution's documentation to install :

* A webserver (like nginx, Apache, lighttpd, cherokee or caddy)
* PHP version > 5.6 (7.1 recommended)
* MySQL version > 5.5 (5.7 recommended)
* Git (optional but recommended)

.. tip:: If you don't know how to do that, or can't update php, have a look at :ref:`installing eLabFTW on a drop <install-drop>` or :ref:`in a docker container <install>`.

.. note:: I wouldn't recommend HHVM because Gettext support is not here yet (see `this issue <https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues/1228>`_). Also, PHP 7 is here and is fast.

Getting the files
-----------------

The first part is to get the `eLabFTW` files on your server.

Connect to your server with SSH:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh user@12.34.56.78

`cd` to the public directory where you want `eLabFTW` to be installed (can be /var/www/html, ~/public\_html, or any folder you'd like, as long as the webserver is configured properly, in doubt use /var/www/html)

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /var/www/html
    # make the directory writable by your user (if it's not already the case)
    $ sudo chown `whoami`:`whoami` .

Note the `.` at the end that means `current folder`.

Get latest stable version via git:

.. we have to use parsed-literal here and not code-block otherwise the substitution doesn't work :/

.. parsed-literal::

    $ git clone -b |release| --depth 1 https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw.git

The `--depth 1` option is to avoid downloading the whole history.

.. tip:: If you cannot connect, it's probably the proxy setting missing; try one of these two commands:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ export https_proxy="proxy.example.com:3128"
        $ git config --global http.proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080

Install php dependencies with `composer <https://getcomposer.org/download/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd elabftw
    # step not described: install composer
    # see https://getcomposer.org/download/
    $ ./composer.phar install --no-dev

This will populate the `vendor` directory and also complain about missing php extensions that you should install.


SQL part
--------

The second part is putting the database in place.

Option 1: Command line way
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    # first we connect to mysql
    $ mysql -uroot -p
    # we create the database (note the ; at the end!)
    mysql> create database elabftw;
    # we create the user that will connect to the database.
    mysql> grant usage on *.* to elabftw@localhost identified by 'YOUR_PASSWORD';
    # we give all rights to this user on this database
    mysql> grant all privileges on elabftw.* to elabftw@localhost;
    mysql> exit

You will be asked for the password you put after `identified by` three lines above.


Option 2: Graphical way with phpmyadmin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to install the package `phpmyadmin` if it's not already done.

.. note:: It is not recommended to have phpmyadmin installed on a production server (for security reasons).

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin

Now you will connect to the phpmyadmin panel from your browser on your computer. Type the IP address of the server followed by /phpmyadmin.

Example: https://12.34.56.78/phpmyadmin

Login with the root user on PhpMyAdmin panel (use the password you setup for mysql root user).

Create a user `elabftw` with all rights on the database `elabftw`.

Now click the `Users` tab and click:

.. image:: img/adduser.png

Do like this:

.. image:: img/phpmyadmin.png

Final step
----------

Finally, point your browser to your server and read onscreen instructions.

For example: https://12.34.56.78/elabftw

It's a good idea to subscribe to `the newsletter <http://elabftw.us12.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=61950c0fcc7a849dbb4ef1b89&id=04086ba197>`_, to know when new releases are out (you can also see that from the Sysadmin panel).
