.. warning:: This release contains TWO important changes! Read below.

* **IMPORTANT CHANGE NÂ°1**:

  * The `vendor` directory is not tracked by git anymore. This doesn't impact Docker users BUT THE OTHER POINT BELOW DOES. For git users, you now need to install `composer <https://getcomposer.org>`_. For this update, do like this:

  .. code-block:: bash

      cd /path/to/elabftw
      git pull
      rm -rf vendor # only for this time
      # see https://getcomposer.org to install composer
      composer install --no-dev

  Read the :ref:`new way to update here <how-to-update>`.

* **IMPORTANT CHANGE NÂ°2**:

  * The docker repo changed from elabftw/docker-elabftw to elabftw/elabimg. In order to get the latest version, make sure to edit /etc/elabftw.yml and change the line "image:"; replace "docker-elabftw" with "elabimg".

WARNING DOCKER USERS!!!!! IMPORTANT READ BELOW:

Once you pull the new version and visit a page, the config file will be updated with a new secret key. You need to copy it from inside the container to your docker-compose.yml file!

1. Use `docker ps` to check the ID of the container (or use its name)

2. Replace $ID from the below command with your container ID (or name). This command will extract the new key and place it at the end of your config file.

.. code-block:: bash

    docker exec -it $ID grep SECRET /elabftw/config.php| awk -F \' '{print $4}' >> docker-compose.yml

3. Edit `docker-compose.yml` to replace the old SECRET_KEY value by the new one at the end of the file.

Like shown on this image:

.. image:: img/1.2.1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: update config

For normal users (no docker):

If you have a message asking you to make your config file readable, use this: `chmod 777 config.php`. Execute this command from inside the `elabftw` folder.
Refresh the page to retry. You can put back restrictive permissions after the update is done.

This update is a major update from the php-encryption project. So we need to change how the key is. This key is used to encrypt the SMTP and timestamping passwords.

     * It simplifies the code by removing clutter

  * Timestamping with openssl has a bug! So we use Java.
     * See `this issue <https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/issues/242>`_
